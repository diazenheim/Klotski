## Overview

**Klotski App** is a Java application that simulates the 
Klotski board game allowing to move pieces on a board
with the goal to bring the bigger and red square down to 
the red line at the bottom of the board.
The game is very intuitive and gives the possibility to 
sava a match to reload it in the future but also the standard
possibility to go back until the beginning of the game, step
by stem or reset it immediatelly to the preset configuration. 
Furthermore we added the "Best Move" functionality which guides 
the player from whathever situation he steped in to the end of the game.
